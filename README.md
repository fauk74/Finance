Financial models

The current project provide a tool, all built in Python, to create business plans, with P&L and Cash-Flow. 
The model allow to create several objects of "plan" type, copying, modifying rates and costs to easily build simulations. 
There are built-in functions to calculate the Net Present Value of the business plan, and functions to create sceneries (e.g. linear trends with some randomness). 
Moreover, the model allows to manage quantities and prices, for utilities , raw materials , sales.
